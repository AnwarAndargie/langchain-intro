# langchain-intro

A short example project demonstrating how to use **LangChain**.

## 🚀 What this is

This repository contains a notebook and sample code that walk through how to integrate LangChain for building language-model powered applications.  

## 📂 Contents

- `notebooks/` — A jupyter notebook with step-by-step examples.  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies needed to run the examples.  

## 🛠 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnwarAndargie/langchain-intro.git
   cd langchain-intro
````

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate     # on macOS/Linux
   # or venv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and follow the steps in the notebook.

## 🎯 What you’ll learn

* How to set up LangChain in a project.
* How to load a language model and chain together prompts.
* How to build a minimal end-to-end workflow with LangChain.
* Key concepts and patterns for LLM-powered applications.

## ✅ Good to know

* Ensure you have access to a supported language model (e.g., via OpenAI, local model, etc.).
* Check the `requirements.txt` for compatibility (Python version, library versions).
